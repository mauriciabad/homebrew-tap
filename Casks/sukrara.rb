  caveats <<~EOS
    Sukrara is not notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks the first launch with
    "Apple could not verify “Sukrara” is free of malware…". Click Done, then open
    System Settings → Privacy & Security, scroll to Security and click
    "Open Anyway" next to "“Sukrara” was blocked…", and confirm with your password.
    This is needed once. Apple's guide:
